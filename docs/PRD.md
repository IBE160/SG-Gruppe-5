## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **Empower Users:** Enable students and recent graduates to create high-quality, customized job applications with confidence and efficiency.
- **Save Time:** Significantly reduce the time and effort required to tailor a CV and cover letter for each job application.
- **Increase Confidence:** Boost user confidence by providing AI-powered tools to optimize their application materials.
- **Improve Application Quality:** Deliver a tool that generates well-written, relevant, and ATS-optimized application documents.

### Background Context

Students and recent graduates frequently struggle with the time-consuming, tedious, and anxiety-inducing process of tailoring their CVs and cover letters for each job application. This manual effort makes it difficult to consistently highlight relevant skills and effectively navigate Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), creating a significant barrier to success in a competitive job market. The AI CV & Job Application Assistant will automate and optimize this process, providing substantial time savings, increasing user confidence, and reducing the stress associated with the job search.
